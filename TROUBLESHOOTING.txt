=======
General
=======

To debug a problem, it is often useful to look at a detailed log. Edit
the settings.cfg file and change the logging level to DEBUG (from
the default of WARNING) and run the program. At INFO even more output
is logged.


=====
Video
=====

1) You should install the latest video drivers for your graphics card,
   probably from the manufacturer's website, for best results. OpenGL
   support is often better that way on Windows. On Linux, make sure
   that accelerated OpenGL is functional (try running glxgears, for
   example).

2) If you can't load the client, you can try setting the graphic level quality
   lower. Consult the Sauerbraten/Cube 2 documentation,

    http://sauerbraten.org/docs/config.html

   You can pass config parameters to intensity_client.py just like
   to the Sauerbraten client. For example,

       python intensity_client.py -f0 local/client

   will disable shaders, and use the home directory of local/client
   for config files and so forth.

3) ATI hardware may fall victim to an issue that causes *very* low
   framerates. Cube 2 has a fix for that, which is to add

        ati_texgen_bug 0

   To the file

        data\default_map_settings.cfg

4) If you are experiencing low frame rates, you can change, in
   ~/intensityengine_client/settings.cfg (on Windows, replace "~" with
   your home directory, something like "C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME"
   on XP or or "C:\Users\USERNAME" on Vista):

        [Physics]
        frame_time = 10

   to something else. 10 means a physics frame is done every 10 milliseconds
   which translates to 1000/10=100 frames per second. You can try 20,
   which gives 50fps, and so forth, but this might affect gameplay.


==========
Networking
==========

1) Make sure your firewall lets the server use the port it wants. How to do
   this depends on what firewall you use. E.g. with the Windows XP SP2
   firewall, you should just tell it to not block the server when the
   firewall pops up as the server starts.

   The server currently uses ports 28787-28789.


=======
Windows
=======

1) On Windows, if you get an error like 

    "ImportError: DLL load failed: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect"

   then you might need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package,

    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF&displaylang=en

   We hope to automate this in the future.

2) On Windows 7 or Vista and AMD/ATI cards, there might be a memory leak issue. A
   fix is available,

=====
Linux
=====

1) On Linux, if you have missing libraries, you may need to run the following
   command, for Ubuntu 8.10 (other distros might have slightly different names)

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2 libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2 libboost-python1.34.1

   Basically, you need need SDL (including SDL Image and SDL Mixer), and Boost.Python2.

2) If sounds appear 'delayed' or 'lagging' - for example, the jump sound doesn't
   play immediately when you jump - then the cause might be Pulseaudio. You can try
   to run without Pulseaudio (for example, by doing 'killall pulseaudio' on Ubuntu -
   but be careful, as this might have effects on other applications that need sound).
