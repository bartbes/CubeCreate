COMPILE
=======


General
=======

The Intensity Engine should work on Windows and Linux (and perhaps other
platforms as well by the time you read this). Compilation instructions for
the two platforms have some shared aspects and some non-shared aspects.
The following are the shared aspects.

1. In both cases you should get the source code, either a zip file/tarball
   with a release, or straight from the source code repository, in which
   case you can simply do

        git clone git://github.com/kripken/intensityengine.git

   You need the Git version control system installed,

        http://git-scm.com/

    See www.intensityengine.com for more details.

2. Building was previously done using SCons, a next-generation build tool. SCons
   requires Python, which you will need anyhow for the Intensity Engine.
   See the old versions of this document for building with SCons.

   Building is now done using CMake, another next-generation build tool.
   The CMake build system has some limitations at the moment:

        * You need to compile V8 yourself (it uses SCons)
        * You need to run generate_messages.py yourself, if you modify
            the messages.template file. Do so by running

                python src/generate_messages.py

            in the install directory.

3. After compiling, see the README.txt file for instructions on running
   the Intensity Engine.

4. 64-bit systems should be able to natively compile the current version of
   Google V8 in the Intensity Engine, which recently gained x86_64
   support. Older versions would only work on 32-bit systems (and ARM),
   leading to errors like

       ld: skipping incompatible src/thirdparty/v8/libv8.a when searching for -lv8

   For solutions for those older versions, see

       http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=29

   (but again, the current version should work fine on 64-bit systems).

   Another possible reason for a 'skipping incompatible' error as
   mentioned above is if V8 builds itself in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit
   system. This shouldn't happen but seems to occur on some systems.
   To fix it, compile V8 yourself by doing

       scons arch=x64

   in the directory src/thirdparty/v8.



Specific Platforms
==================

Linux
=====

The following explains how to install on Ubuntu (9.04 and 9.10). We welcome
feedback about your experience in other distros, so we can add it to this file.
In general, in other distros (or versions of Ubuntu) there might be minor changes
to the package names and so forth, but overall, things should be similar.

First, install Git, CMake, SCons and other important stuff:

  Ubuntu 9.04:
    sudo apt-get install git-core cmake scons build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev python-dev libboost-python1.35-dev zlib1g-dev   

  Ubuntu 9.10:
    sudo apt-get install git-core cmake scons g++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libboost-python1.38-dev

Check out the source code:

    git clone git://github.com/kripken/intensityengine.git

Go to the V8 directory, ./src/thirdparty/v8, and run

    scons

there. Then go back down to the base dir, and to ./cbuild, and run

    cmake ..

this should configure things correctly. Then run

    make

Some specific comments:

  * To get around an issue with V8 on newer gcc versions,
    http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=463 ,
    you should enter src/thirdparty/v8 and run

         GCC_VERSION="44" scons

    This is necessary on Ubuntu 9.10 (but not 9.04).

  * If you get a link error about not finding v8, then v8 may not have compiled
    correctly. Run 'scons' in src/thirdparty/v8 to see the errors. One existing issue
    is that on GCC 4.4+, you need to disable some warnings,

        http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=413

    Following the fixes there can solve the problem (requires editing the SConstruct
    file in the v8 directory).

  * If you get

        gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory

    when compiling V8, then installing ia32-libs may fix it, see

        http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=289



Windows
=======

Acquiring all the various libraries needed to compile the project is
somewhat of a hassle. The main website should have a download
that can help, check at

    http://github.com/kripken/intensityengine/downloads

The windows_dev.zip file is what you need for compilation. Place the
contents under /src/windows_dev. (The windows_runtime.zip contains
the runtime dlls, which should be placed under /windows/dll in the
install directory). Note that you will be merging the contents of
the src/windows_dev/include directory.

If instead you want/need to get the development headers and libraries
yourself, then you should do the following: Get the following
items, and place them under /src/windows_dev (if you place them
elsewhere, you will need to edit the SConstruct file so it can find them):

   1. Get Git from http://git-scm.com/ , if you want to get the source code
      from the repo.
   2. Get SCons from www.scons.org.
   3. Get SDL from www.libsdl.org, (something like) SDL-devel-1.2.13-VC8.zip,
      as well as SDL-image and SDL-mixer
        - Note that SDL-image should come with libpng (if this is missing,
          you will get 'failure to load core textures'), as well as jpeg.dll
        - Note that SDL-mixer should come with libogg-0.dll, libvorbis-0,
          libvorbisfile-3
   4. Boost: Use the installer, http://www.boostpro.com/products/free. Get
      the "Multithread, DLL" version. We basically need the headers
      for shared_ptr, and boost_python binary (so you can just
      install those).????????
   5. ?? TODO: OpenGL headers ??
   6. Get zlib from www.zlib.net
   7. Get CMake


In the directory where the source code was placed (usually 'intensityengine'),
run (in a DOS shell, that is, inside cmd.exe) the following commands.

First, build V8 by going to src\thirdparty\v8 and running

    scons mode=release env="INCLUDE:C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\Include;,LIB:C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\Lib;"

(change the path to point to where you have the Windows platform SDKs).

Then, go back up and do \cbuild, and there run

    SET INTENSITY_DEP_PATH = ..\src\windows_dev
    cmake ..

this should create a project file for VC++, which you can then build.

Some things to be aware of:

    * If you get pre-compiled libraries, they must be of a sort appropriate for
      your compiler. Some projects are nice and provide various versions for
      you, so pick wisely.
    * Pre-compiled Boost binaries, in particular those in windows_dev.zip, are
      linked against Python 2.5.x. Using another version of Python in addition to
      that may cause errors (see 'version mismatch?' below). The simplest solution
      is to use Python 2.5.x. Or, build Boost from scratch so there is no dependency
      on Python 2.5.
    * In general, it is best to use Python 2.5.x for everything, as trying to use
      another version for some things may cause confusion. However, if you build
      all the dependencies entirely from scratch, it should not be hard to use
      a later Python version (2.6 or 2.7 - not 3.0), in which case again you
      should use just that version for everything.
    * Related to the last point, if you get

        "Fatal Python Error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)"

      then that might be caused by linking against one version of Python but running
      against another. To check, look for files of the type python*.dll (python24.dll,
      python25.dll, python26.dll, etc.) Remove all but the right python*.dll file from
      your path. (In particular, perhaps SCons places python25.dll in the path.)
      NOTE: In some cases the error Windows provides for this problem may be less clear,
      such as "exception 0xc0000005", which is a general fault due to reading from
      an invalid location. Note that such an error may also indicate a completely
      different problem.
    * Need to rename the C Modules from .dll to .pyd, Python 2.5+ wants that.
      This is done by the SCons files, in a slightly hackish manner however.
    * When testing with MSVC++ 2008, the following were needed: msvcr90.dll,
      msvcp90.dll. Present in Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package,
      http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF&displaylang=en
      Sometimes just copying these files isn't enough (although they appear in
      the binary releases that way). The solution is to install the complete
      Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, see e.g. the FAQ at
            http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/CommonMistakes#Exceptions_and_Asserts
      (item 6), leading to
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299(VS.80).aspx
    * If you get error R6034, then that is because you need to have .manifests
      *inside* your files, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235560(VS.80).aspx
      The SCons files do this, in a slightly hackish manner however. Basically, the solution is
          mt.exe –manifest Intensity_CServer.dll.manifest -outputresource:Intensity_CServer.pyd;2
          mt.exe –manifest Intensity_CClient.dll.manifest -outputresource:Intensity_CClient.pyd;2
      where mt.exe is from the Microsoft Platform SDK. In other words, the
      manifests have been prepared, and are in 'build', but they haven't been baked into the dlls.
    * You need the already mentioned Microsoft Platform SDK.
    * You should place development files in src/windows_dev, according to the file structure
      laid out there. Otherwise, you will need to edit the SConstruct file to change paths.
    * If you need to change paths (which you might, if you install e.g. the Platform SDK
      somewhere else than what the SConstruct file assumes), this can be changed in the SConstruct
      file. Note that the SConstruct file is written in Python, so its syntax is hopefully
      familiar. The relevant things to change would be variables like shared_includes,
      client_libs, etc.
    * If you get "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found", then
      look at the line above it for what import failed. You can use Microsoft's
      Process Monitor/File Monitor tools to help debug things.
    * "Error R6034: An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly"
      This might be caused by not having manifests, see above. Or, it might be related to incorrect
      linking with the C runtime. It seems to occur on Windows 2003 and Vista, due to their different
      method of handling C runtimes - work is in progress to fix this. See

            http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2609380&group_id=78018&atid=551954

      for some info.
    * "LNK4098: defaultlib `LIBCMT` conflicts with use of other libs." This can be ignored for now
      (but it should be fixed).
    * "Cannot open include file: 'pymacconfig.h': No such file or directory"
      Stems from using Python 2.6 include file in windows_dev\python, which an old version of
      windows_dev.zip had. If you are using that version, simply copy from Python25\Include
      the Python.h file to src\windows_dev\include.
    * Make sure to use the same windows platform sdk for both V8 and tIE (not v6.0A one place v6.1 elsewhere).
    * For running, you should place the relevant DLL files (for SDL, etc.) in windows\dll under
      the install directory. This is placed into the path automatically by the Intensity Engine
      startup scripts, so the DLLs can be found. These files should already be there if you
      download a binary version of the Intensity Engine. You should also be able to download
      them from

          http://github.com/kripken/intensityengine/downloads

      The relevant file is windows_runtime.zip.
