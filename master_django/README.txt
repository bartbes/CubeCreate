Intensity Engine - Master Server
================================


Production
----------

For production you will probably want to use
another database instead of Sqlite, which is used
by default. See the Django docs for how to do that.



Notes
-----

Django 1.0 is required; Django 1.1 currently does *not* work,
but hopefully soon will.
