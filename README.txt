CubeCreate
================

http://cubecreate.com/

A new engine and gaming platform based on Syntensity. While Syntensity aims at small hardware requirements and no core changes when possible,
CubeCreate aims to create a modern engine and gaming platform, developed independently.
For now, it's in sync with Sauerbraten and SauerEnhanced:

Current Sauerbraten revision: 3243
Current Sauerbraten Enhanced revision: 288


Notes
=====

Please see 'legacy docs' for incomplete guides on compiling and running the
engine. We are currently in the process of updating our docs.
