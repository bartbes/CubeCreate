//! Extensions to the Sauerbraten client-server messaging system

//! Instead of hard-coding messages into fpsserver.h as in Sauerbraten, we instead have the
//! following general system, where MessageTypes are registered, and the MessageManager then
//! calls the appropriate MessageType to handle a packet. Message types themselves are defined
//! in the messages.template file, which is then used to autogenerate C++ code, with no risk
//! of misreading or miswriting.

namespace MessageSystem
{

//! The goal with MessageType is to encapsulate in one local area all the logic related to one message. In particular,
//! we should strive to have both the code generating the message and the code reading the message here (and not spread
//! out over client and server files separately as in Sauer). Another goal is to not conflate server and client messages:
//! There should be a different message type for server->client and client->server, even if they are very similar
//! (if so, inheritance of other code-sharing methods are relevant), unlike Sauer which reuses the messages for both
//! directions, and it seems that this means not all message contents are used (one direction might not need it all) -
//! but not sure about that.
