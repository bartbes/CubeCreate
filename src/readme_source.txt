In the lower part of this file you can find the original license
appearing with the Sauerbraten source code. Here are some clarifications
regarding that license and its relationship to the Intensity Engine
and its license.

The Intensity Engine is built using Sauerbraten, and (as Sauerbraten's
ZLIB license allows) adds licensing terms to those files, namely,
additional conditions in the form of the GNU AGPL 3.0 license (see LICENSE
in the parent directory). Use of *any* of the files - those originating
from Sauerbraten, or those new to the Intensity Engine - is only under the
*overall* license, which is the AGPL.

Contact me (Kripken) to discuss ZLIBing some of the new Intensity Engine
stuff, if something interests you - I will most likely agree. In fact
a lot of it was offered to upstream Sauerbraten. Furthermore, see
www.intensityengine.com regarding future plans to move all of the
Intensity Engine code to a permissive license.

Sauerbraten people!
